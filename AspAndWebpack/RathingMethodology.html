            <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The IHS Economics and Country Risk team scores risk numerically alongside its qualitative text-based forecasts. These
            scores are comparable across countries. They range from 0.1 to 10 with steps of 0.1 on a logarithmic scale, so
            a score increase from 8.1 to 8.2 represents a larger increase in risk than a move from 1.1 to 1.2. Each score
            represents the average expected level of risk over the next year. These indices are dynamic.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How scores are set and reviewed</strong>
        </p>
        <p>IHS economists and country risk analysts score risks based on their own expert understanding of the countries' political,
            economic, social, and security environment, using economic models, information from open sources, and structured
            intelligence gathered by a network of thousands of in-country personnel. Daily written assessments highlight
            a country's changing conditions and inform the risk scores. In addition to in-house expertise and models, IHS
            draws on experts in the field and in-country sources with proven records of reliability. Our wide network of
            external analysts and contacts gives us access to local, specific, and granular information. The country risk
            scores also benefit from the insight and data generated for two other specialised IHS risk products – the Sovereign
            Risk Service and the Global Risk Service.</p>
        <p>Analysts can move the scores at any time in light of significant events that signal changes in the risk environment.
            Event-driven risk score changes can reflect developments such as elections, significant violent attacks, or a
            change in government policies. Regional desk meetings take place every week to review any such developments and
            their impact on the scores. The regional desk also reviews scores for any given country on a rolling basis, at
            least quarterly, alongside a qualitative review of the written briefs, or production of quarterly economic forecasts.</p>
        <p>IHS's dedicated Risk Center works with analysts to regularly review scores and relative country rankings. An independent
            quarterly global review is carried out by auditors from the Political Violence and Political Risk teams as well
            as the Risk Center experts, who examine the scores for contextual and statistical consistency in a regional and
            global context. This review is aided by statistical metrics set and run by the Risk Center. The regional desks
            hold a meeting with the Risk Center to review their region's scores comprehensively on an annual basis.</p>

        <h2>
            <a name="Political"></a>Political Risk</h2>
        <h3>
            <a name="Government"></a>Government Instability</h3>
        <p>Reflects the risk that the central, sovereign, or highest political authority in a country, or the individuals or
            groups constituting it, will change in the next year. In most cases this will be a government (used as shorthand
            below). The risk of forced change (e.g. by a coup, popular uprising, civil war, vote of no confidence, or impeachment)
            scores considerably higher than change in the course of ordinary politics, for example, a scheduled election,
            voluntary change of cabinet, or internal party elections. (This category does not capture any impact on policy).</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">
                <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span>
            </span> - The government is internally unstable and its authority is severely challenged by various groups and any political
            opposition. A disorderly overthrow of the government is highly likely in the next year, probably as a result
            of a violent coup, popular uprising or civil war, and quite possibly with some degree of international support.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - The government's authority is severely challenged domestically and maybe internationally.
            It faces a significant risk of being forcefully changed in the coming year. The change will not be orderly and
            those coming to power may have done so thanks to foreign support.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - Frequent, widespread, and increasingly bold challenges to the government's authority from
            civil society groups or political opposition are likely to force a change in government the next year. While
            forced, the change will be relatively orderly (e.g. a vote of no confidence) and will not alter the fundamental
            institutions of government significantly.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - The government may rely on holding a coalition together to stay in power, and this is becoming
            harder to do as its popularity falls and divisions emerge. There is therefore a growing risk that the government
            will be dissolved and elections called in the next year, outside the normal election cycle. A new party and leader
            has a significant chance of winning this election; OR Elections are due in the next year and opinion polls point
            firmly to a heavy defeat for the incumbent and a change of government.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - The government is fairly stable. Its authority faces occasional external challenges from
            civil society groups, either domestic- or foreign-based. The government may be removed from power by organised
            political opposition in the course of ordinary politics within the next year. Forced change, however, remains
            unlikely.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - The government is stable and does not face significant challenges to its authority domestically
            or internationally. There is a small chance of a change in government in the one-year outlook but this is likely
            to be in the course of ordinary politics in the country.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - The country's government is well-established, internally stable, well-supported domestically
            and respected internationally. There is little genuinely credible challenge to its authority (although perhaps
            to its policies) from any organised political opposition, civil society groups or powerful individuals. There
            is almost no chance of the government changing in the next year.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="Policy"></a>Policy Direction</h3>
        <p>The risk the government's broad policy framework shifts over the next year, making the business environment more
            challenging. This might include e.g. implementing more onerous employment or environmental regulation, local
            content requirements, import/export barriers, tariffs or quotas, other protectionist measures, price controls
            or caps, more 'political' control of monetary policy, or simply more direct intervention into the operations
            and decisions of private companies etc.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - The state is highly likely to make sudden, unilateral decisions that prevent businesses from
            operating efficiently or generating profits. These decisions are likely to curtail the ability of businesses
            across sectors from operating day-to-day or make strategic decisions. These decisions are likely to be sudden
            and directed from the national authority, rather than going through a debate or negotiation process with civil
            society or political groups.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - The state is highly likely to pass fundamental legislation extensively expanding its scope
            to intervene in the day-to-day operations and strategic decisions of private enterprises. This will accompany
            other policy initiatives likely to make it much harder for businesses to operate efficiently or generate profits.
            This highly likely to be in light of ongoing public debate, and supported by opposition political groups and
            influential civil society groups.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - In the next year, the state is likely to make significant changes to or pass new legislation
            affecting the operations of several sectors, or change fundamental legislation outlining the rights of state
            bodies to intervene in the strategic decisions of private enterprises. This highly likely to be in light of ongoing
            public debate, and supported by opposition political groups and influential civil society groups.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - Opposition political groups' and influential civil society bodies' criticism of state policy
            towards private enterprise represent broad public opinion. In response the state is likely to adjust its policies
            in the next year. In addition to regulatory changes, this may include new legislation in some sectors to expand
            the scope for state oversight of decisions by private enterprise.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - The state's policies affecting private enterprise are regularly challenged by opposition
            political parties in addition to civil society groups. Criticism is likely - but need not be - centred on the
            freedoms of foreign firms and/or investors. The state is likely to respond by adjusting some regulations but
            is unlikely to abandon its commitment to domestic and foreign private enterprise.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - State policies affecting private enterprise remain stable but are increasingly challenged
            in the specialised political discourse among influential think tanks and/ or segments of civil society. The state,
            however, remains unlikely to fundamentally alter its support of private enterprise as the driver of the national
            economy and is evidently keen to encourage both domestic and foreign businesses. Well-organised and influential
            think tanks and/ or civil society groups campaign for expanded state oversight, if not outright control, of day-to-day
            and strategic business decisions. This criticism, however, is not a central feature of the political opposition's
            platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - State policies towards private enterprise are stable or on an improving trend. There may
            be specific regulatory changes affecting particular sectors but business policy is consistently based on encouraging
            private enterprise (within the constraints of prudential regulation), with minimal state interference in day-to-day
            or strategic management and/ or discrimination between domestic and foreign firms. There is no significant political
            pressure from civil society or opposition political parties for change.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h3>
            <a name="State"></a>State Failure</h3>
        <p>The risk the state is unable exclusively to ensure public security and law and order, and the supply of basic goods
            like food, water, infrastructure and energy (if state provision of these is severely challenged or entirely supplanted
            by non-state actors, the state has failed). The state may be unable to respond to or manage current or likely
            future emergencies, including natural disasters and financial or economic crises. This may be due to inability
            to collect taxes to fund these activities, government paralysis or collapse.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - The country is effectively a failed state. Not only is state provision of basic security and
            public services severely curtailed or entirely supplanted by groups of non-state actors in most of the country,
            these groups bitterly compete against each other. Basic law and order is absent and state institutions are unable
            to respond. Organised criminal gangs may well have stepped into the power vacuum, and the country is suffering
            from e.g. extensive drug cultivation or trafficking, high homicide and kidnapping rates.</p>
        <p>4.4. to 6.4 - The state can provide some basic services but probably only in the capital/its primary cities, and
            even this is contingent upon foreign support/aid. The central government's writ or tax raising powers do not
            extend to many parts of the country, where local strongmen/warlords effectively run operations and the rule of
            law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - State institutions generally cannot respond effectively to emergencies/crises, perhaps because
            resources are already stretched thin, and have no significant planning to base action on in their event. The
            state's provision of basic security and public services is patchy and unreliable. In some parts of the country
            non-state actors, e.g. warlords or armed insurgents, openly challenge the state's provision of these goods and
            in some cases provide these services themselves. By doing so, these non-state actors may wield substantial informal
            political power, for example, by influencing election polling or contract terms in some areas.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - State institutions are moderately competent and generally funded enough to provide basic
            security and public services in most of the country, but often not effective. In some parts however, the state
            cannot be relied on for these goods. The state does not have the capacity to respond robustly to emergencies/crises
            either because of insufficient funding and/ or equipment, or a lack of reliable planning. </p>

            <a name="Bribery"></a>Bribery And Corruption</h3>
        <p>The risk that individuals will face demands for bribes or other corrupt practices in order to carry out business,
            from securing major contracts to being allowed to import/export a small product or obtain everyday paperwork.
            This can threaten a company's ability to operate in a country, or open it up to legal or regulatory penalties
            and reputational damage.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - Navigating demands for bribes and/or corrupt practices among various, competing patronage
            networks, even at the most senior levels of public and private sectors, is intrinsic to doing business in the
            country. Demands will be substantial and probably recurring. The progress of projects, and perhaps even physical
            safety, is contingent upon them. Anti-corruption legislation, if any, is very rarely enforced unless to persecute
            political or business rivals.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - Multiple patronage networks demand bribes and other corrupt practices and are often in competition
            with each other. Failure to cooperate with them puts contracts at risk. The networks are well-embedded in local
            business, bureaucratic, and political networks and their demands are fairly predictable. Businesses, especially
            those unfamiliar with local networks, typically have no legal recourse to demands for bribes and/or corrupt practices.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - Bribe-taking and/or corrupt practices are widespread in both public and private sectors and
            junior- and middle-levels of seniority. Many public officials will have had to pay bribes to secure their positions
            and now wish to 'capitalise' on their investment. Refusal to engage usually risks contracts. Firms without established
            local business networks generally use 'recommended' local subcontractors, even to secure basic services such
            as telephone connections and electricity. Most institutions are captured by local interests. Anti-corruption
            legislation is weak and/often arbitrarily enforced.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - Small bribes demands and/ or some corrupt practices are common from junior-level state bureaucrats
            for granting operating licences. Refusal to pay bribes and/or engage in corrupt practices sometimes leads to
            project cancellation. Bureaucratic procedures to obtain operating permits are inefficient and widely perceived
            as regularly abused. Requests for facilitation payments are likely in order to secure or expedite paperwork,
            and are pretty endemic at customs. Anti-corruption legislation is weak and/or inconsistently enforced.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - Bribes demands and/ or corrupt practices are typical but these tend to be relatively small
            and are generally restricted to particular sectors. Bureaucratic procedures for operating licences are inefficient
            and open to abuse. Refusal to pay bribes and/or engage in corrupt practices generally delays projects but typically
            does not lead to their cancellation. Anti-corruption legislation may be well-established but is not comprehensively
            enforced.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - There have been occasional well-publicised cases of businesses facing demands for bribes
            to enhance their commercial prospects in the last three years but such demands remain uncommon. The state bureaucracy
            is mostly efficient, with few opportunities to demand corrupt payments, but is not highly transparent by international
            standards. Businesses under pressure for bribes and/or corrupt practices have recourse to well-established anti-corruption
            legislation that is robustly enforced.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - Demands for bribes are very rare. Discrimination by regulatory authorities, state bureaucrats,
            or private counterparties in the awarding of business on any grounds other than business merit is also very rare.
            Bureaucratic procedures to obtain operating licences and permits are transparent and efficient, with few opportunities
            to demand corrupt payments. </p>

            widespread areas of strategic political and economic importance where both military and civil cargo aircraft
            come under attack, in the air and on the ground, most days. The attackers will probably have demonstrated the
            capability to engage aircraft using man portable air defence systems (MANPADS), if not high-altitude surface-to-air
            missiles, as well as with low-level air defence (heavy machine guns). Heavy weapons (typically, Grad-type rockets,
            mortars) or vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) will most days cause major targeted or collateral
            damage to airport infrastructure and/or cargo, shutting aviation operations down for months at a time. Aircraft
            and aviation cargo will be subject to arbitrary seizure and/or theft, both by state and non-state actors. (NB:
            A score of 7.5 and above should be reserved for use when there is a CBRN threat capable of inflicting city-wide
            property damage and shutting down aviation operations.)</p>

            the air using low-level air defence weapons and small-arms and are very likely to have access to MANPADS and
            aspire to acquire high-altitude surface-to-air missiles. On the ground, aviation infrastructure will be targeted
            by heavy weapons (typically, Grad-type rockets, mortars) and ground attack using vehicle-borne improvised explosive

            machine guns). Attackers are likely to have limited access to older MANPADS or aspire to acquire them and there
            is an identifiable and feasible source of such weapons.� Airport infrastructure and/or cargo will be at collateral
            risk, if not targeted attack, from heavy weapons (typically, Grad-type rockets, mortars) and ground attack using
            vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). Airport operations are likely to be shut down for up to
            several days at a time. Aircraft and aviation cargo belonging to particular countries/commercial carriers will

            even if the risk of civil or interstate war is assessed as low. Security measures in place in the area(s) exposed
            to violent risk at domestic, if not international airports, are likely to be ineffective in preventing militants
            from attacking airport infrastructure, but they are unlikely to penetrate security to reach aircraft on the ground.�

            on the ground /airport infrastructure are infrequent (once a year or less) and unlikely to cause even minor damage

            or commercial carriers are at high risk of arbitrary seizure and confiscation/theft, both by state and non-state
            actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - Probably as a result of an insurgency or 'for profit' organised crime, the one-year outlook
            includes at least one economically significant area of the coast or territorial, if not adjacent international,
            waters, where military or commercial shipping is targeted, or is at risk of suffering collateral damage or operational
            disruption through fighting or civil unrest onshore or piracy (international waters) or sea robbery (territorial
            waters). Such incidents take place about once a quarter. Alternatively, an armed confrontation, in which at least
            one party has access to anti-shipping missiles, creates a low probability/high impact risk of engagement through
            misidentification, even if civil or interstate war remains a low probability. Security measures in place at ports
            in the affected area(s) are unlikely to be fully effective in mitigating the threat.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - The one-year outlook features identified 'hotspots' where the level of violent risk posed
            shipping and/or port operations by terrorism, 'for profit' crime or violent unrest is higher than the assessed
            country risk score. Commercial shipping and/or warships are a likely aspirational terrorist engagement/IED target
            but intent is not matched by attack capability. Targeted attacks on/collateral damage to ships in port/airport
            infrastructure are infrequent (once a year or less) and unlikely to cause even minor damage or a day's disruption
            to marine operations. Commercial shipping and marine cargo are unlikely to be seized or confiscated providing
            local regulations are respected; when this occurs (e.g. in disputed waters) due process is followed.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - The country's overall business operating environment is generally benign and security measures
            in place are assessed as effective and proportionate to the risk levels posed by terrorism, organised crime and
            violent unrest. Targeted attacks on, or collateral damage to, shipping or port infrastructure are rare (once
            in last five years), if they have occurred at all. Any disruption to marine operations as a result of unrest
            or industrial action is likely to be infrequent (once a year or less) and very unlikely to cause damage. Any
            disruption/delay to marine operations is unlikely to last more than several days. Commercial shipping and marine
            cargo on lawful business face a low risk of seizure; when this occurs due process is followed.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - The country's business operating environment is benign and security measures are assessed
            as effective and proportionate to the risk levels posed by terrorism, organised crime and violent unrest. Attacks
            on/collateral damage to commercial shipping and marine cargo are virtually unknown. Major disruption/delay at
            ports by civil unrest or industrial action is rare (less than once a year) and leads to delays of a few days
            at the most. Commercial shipping and marine cargo on lawful business face a negligible risk of seizure; if this
            occurs, due process will be followed.</p>

        <h3>
            <a name="Protests"></a>Protests and Riots</h3>
        <p>The likelihood, nature and impact of protests and riots (excluding those related to labour), particularly if these
            disrupt normal movement, operations and activity, cause damage to assets or injure or detain people. The nature
            and impact of the state's response should also be factored in here.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - Civil groups are challenging the state and looking to overthrow the government, regularly
            amassing several hundred thousand protesters for protests and riots lasting more than two weeks at a time. The
            state loses control of major population centres which become 'no-go' areas for security forces. Security forces
            are authorised to use lethal force; their response can itself cause property damage and death/injury, and serve
            to escalate rather than de-escalate levels of unrest. Some protesters may cause property damage and/or injury
            through the use of arson, small IEDs and small-arms fire. Certain assets (e.g. government or those associated
            with a particular political party or nationality etc.) may be singled out and subjected to deliberate and significant
            damage. Certain groups of people (based on political affiliations, ethnicity, nationality etc.) may be singled
            out for temporary detention, severe beatings or even killing, with high risks also for bystanders. A large proportion
            of business activity is halted for weeks at a time and state services (including transport, power, communication,
            health and sanitation) are severely curtailed. EXAMPLES: Egypt anti-Morsi, Ukraine Maidan protests</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - Civil groups are challenging the government but fall short of threatening its survival. They
            nonetheless amass tens of thousands of protesters in key cities for protests and riots lasting up to a week.
            Protests often turn into riots with significant damage to property from thrown projectiles and arson with high
            death and injury risk especially from a heavy handed security force response. Business activity tends to be halted
            for the duration of the unrest. OR; there is a moderate likelihood that the unrest will lead to a populist response
            by the government, leading to major concessions like the cancelation or at least very lengthy/costly delays to
            controversial laws, projects etc. EXAMPLES: Egypt mid-2014</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - There are very frequent (monthly), large-scale protests that disrupt business activity and/or
            transport networks in key cities for several days at a time and cause some limited property damage in city centres
            OR; occasional large-scale violent protests or riots causing disruption for several days and moderate damage
            to property in smaller cities / larger towns or rural areas (occasionally at main facilities but usually peripheral
            assets or vehicles outside the main perimeter). Death/injury risks tend to be limited to protest participants
            and the security forces, but with moderate risks to bystanders.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - Frequent (several times a year) large-scale organised protests that cause some disruption
            to transport and business but rarely last more than a week; occasional riots with some vandalism, including damage
            to shop fronts and some looting OR; occasional large-scale violent protests or riots causing damage to property
            in affected areas and/or severe disruption to those specific projects targeted by protesters and the immediate
            vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - Regular smaller-scale non-violent protests (fewer than 10,000 people) that cause some disruption
            to business activity but rarely last longer than 2-3 days - occasionally there is some vandalism during protests
            but this is very limited; OR; Regular but small-scale (fewer than 10,000 people) violent protests in rural areas.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - There are some issues that trigger protests on a regular but infrequent basis and protests
            tend to be orderly and non-violent. Riots are very rare and happen less than once a year - when they do the police
            response tends to be effective in containing violence.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - There are very few organised protests and these are almost never violent.</p>

        <p>The activities of any non-state armed group or individual causing, or likely to cause, property damage and/or death/injury
            through violence. Violent risks posed by organised criminal groups (extortion-related IEDs and arson, shootings
            etc.) should be factored in here. Although insurgency is also covered under 'Civil War', this should be considered
            at the high end of this terrorism risk score scale. Likewise, it's OK that there's overlap with our 'Death and
            Injury' score.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - Major attacks (large VBIEDs, rockets etc.) against a range of buildings, transport and public
            places occur across much of the country most days as the state confronts numerous, well-armed, highly motivated
            and organised insurgents. Loss of life and property damage is significant and includes the complete destruction
            of assets. NB: A score above 7.5 must be used if terrorists possess, or are close to acquiring, a deployable
            CBRN capability able to inflict mass civilian casualties (1,000+) and/or city-wide property damage (such as a
            tactical nuclear device). Aside from an actual attack, security forces' disruption of developed attack plans
            or evidence, not just of terrorist intent, but of developing technical capability/theft of the materials needed
            would be indicators justifying this score. EXAMPLES: Iraq</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - Terrorist groups conduct large-scale bomb attacks causing complete or partial destruction
            of assets in both urban and rural locations killing more than 10 people per incident most weeks; the state's
            security apparatus is very inadequate to meet the threat. OR; in countries with active insurgent groups, significant
            attacks on security forces, government assets and private business assets occur several times a week and can
            regularly lead to complete disruption to business activities in affected areas and significant population displacement.
            OR; organised criminal groups conduct several major VBIED attacks per month, causing major property damage and
            loss of life (must be roughly comparable with Pablo Escobar in Colombia late 80s/early 90s). EXAMPLES: Afghanistan,
            Nigeria
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - There is a significant terrorism problem, with successful attacks at least every one or two
            months causing deaths and some property damage. However, attacks tend to be focussed on specific geographies
            or sectors rather than be truly nationwide. OR; capable domestic actors have a clear agenda to bring down the
            government by targeting sensitive assets and their attacks succeed regularly (at least every one or two months).
            OR; multiple organised criminal groups use small-scale IEDs, arson or shootings at least several times per month;
            these tend to be directed at direct criminal rivals or security forces but can also inflict major damage and
            / or death/injury to those refusing to pay extortion. Large-scale gun battles between rival criminal groups are
            commonplace, including in public places in urban centres (especially if frequented by our client set or those
            they are responsible for).</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - There are frequent (at least every other month), low capability bomb attacks (partial property
            destruction), small-arms attacks or fighting with security forces that can disrupt business activity. OR; the
            country is a proven or likely target for attacks by regional or international groups with proven capability and
            reach. Occasional attacks causing mass casualties and large-scale property destruction are likely, although less
            frequently than once a year. OR; organised criminal groups or single-issue activists carrying out fairly frequent
            (monthly) small-scale IED or arson attacks but these tend to be confined to a narrow set of targets and geographies
            and rarely cause major property damage or injury. (Be careful not to inflate: incidents like the 2009 Athens
            Stock Exchange IED are relatively significant for Greece, but we'd need to believe such attacks will become the
            norm or even expand in order to justify a score of >3.1). OR; Although the extremely high homicide-per-capita
            rate is primarily driven by inter-gang shootings, innocent bystanders are occasionally injured/killed.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - There are domestic armed groups that actively target assets or people in some parts of the
            country but with limited capability (pipe bombs and other small explosive devices, small-scale arson, vandalism).
            OR; the country is an aspirational target for jihadis or other extremist groups (though most indicators suggest
            sizeable attacks will be very rare - less than every three years). OR; there are numerous organised crime groups
            and gangs that fight each other and security forces but rarely target property or uninvolved civilians; collateral
            harm to bystanders occurs occasionally (a few times per year) but is unlikely to become the norm.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - There have been very occasional incidents of low capability bomb attacks (non-lethal and
            very limited property damage), arson, foiled plots or the arrest of suspects. In general, threats from domestic
            terrorist groups are very constrained and primarily limited to small-scale vandalism. Even if the country features
            on jihadist and other extremist websites there is little to suggest a successful attack will materialise in the
            coming year.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - There is little to no terrorism threat and scant precedent. Any domestic actors with political
            or other grievances are unlikely to resort to terrorism and if they did, their capability would be minimal. The
            country is not a prominent target on websites of jihadists or other groups.</p>

            <a name="InternalConflict"></a>Internal Conflict
            <span class="small">(known in ECR as Civil WAR)</span>
        </h3>
        <p>The likelihood and impact of intra-state military conflict (in the form of an organised insurgency, separatist conflict
            or full-blown civil war where rebels/insurgents are attempting to overthrow the government, achieve regional
            independence or at least heavily influence major government policies).</p>
        <p>
            <strong>*NB:</strong> Some definitions of civil war use casualty rates (e.g. >1,000 in total or per year) to distinguish
            them from insurgency/terrorism. Some insist the state/government must be one of the parties in an internal conflict;
            however, this would mean we'd exclude things like Sunni v Shia militias in Iraq, violence between rival militias
            in Libya or between the various rebels groups within Syria, Tutsi v Hutu in DRC etc. Although by no means definitive,
            we will use the rule of thumb that the non-state armed group(s) in question would normally have a relatively
            organised military force, exercise de facto authority over the population within a determinate portion of the
            national territory and have an organisation purporting to have the characteristics of a state (borrowing from
            the ICRC's definition). Violence by such groups should feature in our analysis and risk scores for both civil
            war and terrorism. However, any violence by groups which do not broadly meet the criteria above should feature
            in terrorism only.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - There is either an ongoing large-scale civil war or one will almost certainly erupt in the
            one-year outlook. Military forces are deployed in sustained operations in a significant part of the country and
            fighting involves the regular use of air strikes, medium/long range missiles and armour and/or field artillery,
            targeting strategic infrastructure, transport hubs, population centres and commercial assets alongside security
            forces. Outside actors may be providing significant and ongoing 'game changing' backing for one or more of the
            belligerents, e.g. via supplies of advanced weapons systems, financing, political legitimisation, training, military
            advice, safe haven, covert asymmetrical operations etc. Meaningful negotiations or a peacekeeping mission to
            end the civil war are very unlikely. There is significant property destruction and damage on a daily basis arising
            from the use of air strikes and/or heavy weapons, and most business activity is severely disrupted. Targeting
            often appears indiscriminate, with collateral victims the norm. NB: For any score above 7.5, CBRN weapons are
            available to main protagonists and are at a real risk of being used. EXAMPLES: Syria, Iraq</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - There is either an ongoing civil war or one will likely erupt in the one-year outlook. Military
            forces are deployed in operations in some parts of the country and fighting involves some use of air strikes,
            medium/long range missiles and armour and/or field artillery, targeting strategic infrastructure, transport hubs,
            population centres and commercial assets alongside security forces. Outside actors may be providing occasional
            yet substantial backing to one or more of the belligerents, which serves to significantly prolong the conflict
            and can result in periodic spikes in violence, long-term geographical shifts in the conflict and more ambitious
            targeting for prolonged periods. There is regular property destruction and damage arising from the use of air
            strikes and/or heavy weapons and regular disruption to business activity in some areas but several key cities
            have functioning services. Although some strikes may be clinical in nature, collateral victims are very common.
            Rebels/insurgents may often resort to asymmetrical tactics like major VBIEDs in urban centres, often targeting
            government/security force buildings or clusters of rival civilian groups; collateral property damage and harm
            to individuals is common in such cases.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - Despite the absence of a full-blown civil war, there is a significant ongoing campaign against
            insurgents in parts of the country or this is likely in the one-year outlook. Protagonists use primarily small-arms,
            including RPGs, machine guns and mortars, although there can be occasional use of field artillery, armour and
            anti-aircraft weapons. Air strikes are uncommon but occasional. Most fighting is primarily in rural areas rather
            than key cities and commercial hubs. Nevertheless, such urban locations are occasionally targeted by VBIEDs (mostly
            government/security force targets but with significant collateral risks). Some insurgent attacks target key infrastructure
            and rural commercial assets (e.g. power or energy). Outside actors may be providing occasional and limited support
            for one or more of the belligerents, allowing them to hold ground they would otherwise lose but probably not
            sufficient to take new ground or regularly undertake more ambitious targeting.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - There is a limited insurgency being fought against state security forces in parts of the
            country. Fighting with insurgents primarily involves the use of small-arms, including RPGs, machine guns and
            mortars. Fighting is contained to rural areas and cities in the affected region mostly operate without disruption.
            There is some damage to infrastructure in the affected region and to some smaller population centres. Support
            from outside actors is important for the belligerents but is probably not sufficient to allow them to take new
            ground or expand their normal target sets.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - Groups exist with a separatist agenda but have shunned/been excluded from mainstream politics.
            Their radical fringes occasionally mount protests, advocate insurgency (openly or more covertly via graffiti,
            social media etc) or even make tentative efforts at securing funding/training/political backing for such. Very
            crude IEDs may occasionally be detonated, causing only minor damage and rarely injuries; however, there is little
            risk of civil war emerging in the one-year outlook. EXAMPLES: UK (Northern Ireland)</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - Historical grievances (separatist, ethnic, political etc) exist, but tend to be aired only
            occasionally (e.g. during election campaigning or local-level squabbles) and may lead to rare cases of isolated
            killings. However, there is unlikely to be traction for even a rudimentary insurgency or separatist conflict

            involves regular use of air strikes, medium/long range missiles and armour and/or field artillery, targeting
            strategic infrastructure, transport hubs, population centres; AND/OR very large IEDs are used several times per
            week, causing significant deaths and injury. Single incidents tend to kill more than 25 people. NB. For any score
            above 7.5, a deployable CBRN capability capable of inflicting mass civilian casualties (1,000+) is available
            to and deployable by main protagonists.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - Acts of terrorism, war and/or violent unrest are likely to be frequent with single incidents
            killing more than 10 people occurring most weeks. Countries where incidents are spread across the country with
            this intensity and scale should be at the top of the band whereas countries where incidents are limited to only
            some geographical areas should be towards the lower end, unless these areas are the most populous and likely
            to lead to greater numbers of casualties.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - Acts of terrorism, war and/or violent unrest are likely to occur at least monthly, particularly
            in cities; casualties are frequent and single incidents can kill more than 5 people; attacks and/or fighting
            tends to take place in cities and affect infrastructure and property frequented by foreigners, or areas where
            expatriates live. Local security forces are of very limited effectiveness and are likely to be corrupt and/or
            penetrated by terrorists. AND/OR Large-scale gun battles between rival criminal groups are commonplace, including
            in public places in urban centres (especially if frequented by our client set or those they are responsible for);
            although most injuries and fatalities tend to affect active belligerents, innocent bystanders are often affected
            (top end of this band if frequent and spread across the country).</p>
        <p>

            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - Kidnappings are likely to be frequent (most days) and tend to target foreigners. Incidents
            are likely to involve significant violence including permanent bodily harm or death of victims, either during
            the abduction or captivity. Perpetrators demonstrate a high degree of organisation and capability, including
            a willingness to confront directly heavy private security protection. Captivity usually lasts for many months.
            Risks are significant in urban areas, particularly in areas frequented by foreigners or where expatriates live.
            Short-term foreign visitors are targeted regularly. Kidnappings can be either economic or political in nature.
            The state is either inefficient/has no effective systems in place for dealing with kidnap negotiations or there
            is ample evidence of systematic collusion between security forces and kidnappers; rescue attempts by security
            forces often lead to the death of the hostage.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - Kidnappings are likely to be frequent (more than 1/wk) and tend to target foreigners. Incidents
            are likely to involve some violence including bodily harm and occasionally death of victims. Kidnapping is an
            increasingly common tactic for organised criminal gangs to push extortion demands or pressure rivals. It is common
            for captivity to last several months. Kidnapping risks are significant in urban areas. Kidnappings are likely
            to be political in nature but the state is efficient/has effective systems in place for dealing with kidnap negotiations,

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - Kidnappings are likely to be frequent (more than 1/wk) but tend to mostly target middle-
            and high-income locals; resident expats with private security protection are occasionally targeted but short-term
            foreign visitors are rarely victims; perpetrators demonstrate some degree of organisation and kidnappings are
            likely to involve some violence, including bodily harm, but not death; there are occasional incidents of captivity
            lasting for several months; kidnapping risks are notable in urban areas; kidnappings are likely to be economic
            in nature; although the state is relatively efficient/has effective systems in place for dealing with kidnap

        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - Kidnappings are likely to be relatively frequent (more than 1/month) but tend to be perpetrated
            by unsophisticated gangs and target middle-income locals; long-term resident expats without private security
            protection are targeted very occasionally but there is no precedent of short-term foreign visitors being targeted;
            kidnappings are likely to involve some violence but rarely cause lasting bodily harm and it's rare for captivity
            to last for more than a few weeks; kidnapping risks are greater in rural areas but occasionally also occur in
            cities; kidnappings are likely to be economic in nature but the state is efficient/has effective systems in place
            for dealing with kidnap negotiations.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - Kidnappings are likely to be occasional (less than once a month) and occasionally target
            foreigners/locals in particular areas on an opportunity basis; kidnappings are likely to be non-violent and victims
            are almost never killed; kidnappings for ransom rarely happen in cities, although 'express' kidnappings (forced
            detention for a short period while forced to withdraw cash) are very common; the state is efficient/has effective
            systems in place for dealing with kidnap negotiations.</p>
        <p>

        <p>The risk that the country under consideration will be subject to use of force by another state and the resultant
            impacts, covering the spectrum from targeted military strikes against limited targets to full-scale war with
            the likely aim of changing the government and/or occupation? NB: 'war' does not necessarily require a formal
            declaration of war; most state use of force since World War 2 has involved no such declaration. The risk is geographically
            defined to where the risks manifest themselves and impact on clients; for example, use of force by US troops
            in Iraq would impact on Iraq's score but not that of the US.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="ten">6.5 to 10</span> - There is either an ongoing inter-state military conflict involving major ground/air operations,
            with the likely aim of changing the government or one will almost certainly erupt in the one-year outlook. Opposing
            military forces are deployed on operations in a significant part of the country and fighting involves the regular
            use of air strikes, medium/long range missiles and armour and/or field artillery, targeting strategic infrastructure,
            transport hubs, population centres and commercial assets, as well as armed forces. The whole country is on a
            war footing and there is significant property destruction and damage on a daily basis arising from the use of
            air strikes and/or heavy weapons and most business activity is severely disrupted or halted. Targeting often
            appears indiscriminate, with collateral victims the norm. NB: for any score in the range 7.5-8.4, chemical or
            biological weapons are either already being used to cause mass casualties, or the country concerned has a war-fighting
            CW, BW or nuclear capability (not just possession of some CW stocks) and is assessed as likely to use it, either
            on the battlefield or against civilian population centres. (Example Iran-Iraq war 1980-88.) Any score of 8.5
            and above implies that there is an on-going war with a scale of damage and military and civilian casualties similar
            to that sustained by Germany or the Soviet Union in World War 2)</p>
        <p>
            <span class="eight">4.4 to 6.4</span> - There is either an ongoing inter-state military conflict or one will likely erupt in the
            one-year outlook. Opposing military forces are deployed in operations in some parts of the country and fighting
            involves some use of air strikes, medium/long range missiles and armour and/or field artillery, targeting strategic
            infrastructure, transport hubs, population centres and commercial assets as well as armed forces. There is regular
            property destruction and damage arising from the use of air strikes and/or heavy weapons, and regular disruption
            to business activity in some areas, but several key cities have functioning services. Although some strikes may
            be clinical in nature, collateral victims are very common.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - A long-standing territorial or other dispute between the country and its neighbour(s) results
            in armed forces being maintained at a high level of combat readiness and forward-deployed in close proximity
            to their potential opponents. There are frequent cross-border incidents involving artillery and other heavy weapons
            fire, air strikes and ground incursions, which affect mostly military assets and operations but can occasionally
            cause collateral civilian casualties and disrupt/halt business operations in localised areas. These have the
            capacity to escalate into all-out war, but any such hostilities are likely to have limited objectives and to
            be short-lived. EXAMPLES: Ukraine</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - Poor relations with neighbouring countries lead to regular and disruptive border closures
            or asset seizures (e.g. ships). Any exchanges of fire or other violent incidents are contained to rural border
            areas and cities in the affected region operate without disruption. There is some damage to infrastructure in
            the affected region.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - There is virtually no risk of full-scale inter-state military conflict in the one-year outlook;
            however, the country maintains armed forces capable of defending its territory against external aggression by
            its potential opponents. Poor relations with neighbouring countries lead to occasional but disruptive border
            closures and exchanges of small-arms fire or other violent incidents.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - The country has no territorial or other disputes with its neighbours that give rise to a
            higher than moderate risk of any state use of force against it. The country retains armed forces capable of deterring
            aggression and has the capacity to apply the use of force in support of its foreign policy objectives.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - The country has no territorial or other disputes with its neighbours that give rise to a
            discernable risk of any state use of force against it. The country EITHER a) retains armed forces capable of
            deterring aggression, but adopts a neutral stance in its international relations, avoiding alliances or other
            defence commitments outside its borders OR b) the country, as a matter of policy, denies itself the option of
            use of force, even in a defensive capacity, by not maintaining any standing armed forces. EXAMPLES: Switzerland,

            Main facilities may face occasional minor damage but violence most frequently damages peripheral assets or vehicles
            outside the main perimeter. Non-striking staff or bystanders face high risks of injury and / or of being detained
            temporarily. State services (including transport, power, communication, health and sanitation) can be curtailed
            periodically by strikes / industrial action. A country may score at the higher end of this band if the state's
            response is highly likely to significantly exacerbate / enflame the situation directly (e.g. very heavy-handed
            policing or military deployment causing injury to bystanders and/or collateral damage).</p>
        <p>
            <span class="six">3.2 to 4.3</span> - There is frequent (several times a year), prolonged industrial action in key sectors, affecting
            multiple assets, that closes down or severely disrupts business activity and/or state services (including transport,
            power, communication, health and sanitation) for over a week at a time. Peripheral assets or vehicles outside
            the main perimeter face property damage and/or non-striking staff or bystanders face moderate risks of injury
            and / or of being detained temporarily. Trade unions actively encourage some level of violence. A country may
            score at the higher end of this band if the state's response is likely to exacerbate / enflame the situation
            directly (e.g. heavy-handed policing causing injury to bystanders or employees, which becomes a new protest grievance).</p>
        <p>
            <span class="five">2.4 to 3.1</span> - There is regular industrial action in key sectors, although only occasionally involving multiple
            sectors at the same time or lasting longer than a week. Any violence is mostly limited to scuffles between security
            forces and strikers, with only limited broader collateral damage and injury risks, although peripheral assets
            or vehicles outside the main perimeter face occasional minor property damage. Action may be initiated by representative
            unions but they either tacitly approve some violence or are unable to control all strikers.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="four">1.6 to 2.3</span> - There is regular industrial action in key sectors but rarely lasting longer than three days
            or involving more than one sector at a time. Violence is mostly limited to minor scuffles between security forces
            and strikers.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="two">0.8 to 1.5</span> - Grievances about working conditions and wages usually occur only when households face financial
            pressures and are isolated to particular sectors and typically resolved amicably through dialogue between representative
            trade bodies, employers, and state institutions. Disruption to business activity is minimal and violence is not
            common.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="zero">0.1 to 0.7</span> - There is only occasional industrial action and usually with significant contingency provided
            by the state to minimise disruption. The labour force is well represented by recognised unions that are able
            to engage employers and state institutions in structured dialogue. Working conditions and employment protections
            are very good and wage inequality between industrial sectors is low by international standards. The economy is
            stable and growing and most households do not face financial pressures.</p>
